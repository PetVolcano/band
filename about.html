			<p class="blocktext">It was on a night quite like this… On the corner of Bourbon and Division…where Marlon stumbled upon a fortune teller’s tent.  Having not been in the clearest mind, he decided to enter and have his fortune told.  He sat down on a wooden stool.  She said her name was Greta and told him the price of reading…As he fumbled to smooth out some crumpled bills, he noticed in the corner of the dimly lit space was an aquarium with a large python.</p>
			<p class="blocktext">	“What’s your snake’s name?” he asked.  “That is my pet, Volcano.” She replied, nonchalantly as she focused on her ball.  Suddenly Greta’s eyes glazed white and the snake raised its head high.  She was in a trance and seemed to be connected to the snake.  She spoke suddenly in a hypnotized hissing voice, “You will form a musical duo that will later become a trio.  You will create songs about gypsies, zombies, and runaways, still beating hearts, French love songs, songs about deserts and camels, fire! You will spread your nomadic punk message to the world and stoke the eternal embers of dance and…” Suddenly, there was a distant bang and Greta was awoken out of the trance.  “I lost the signal,” she said. “Come back tomorrow to hear the rest of your future.”</p>
<p class="blocktext">Marlon tiredly exited her tent, somehow found his way home in a daze, and crashed out into his pillow upon landing…In the morning he dreamily remembered the events of the night before. Filled with curiosity, he began his journey back to where the fortune teller had set up her shop.  To some strange surprise, when he arrived (breakfast of coffee and beignet in hand), there was no tent in sight, no trace of its existence.  Did it really happen?  Was it just a dream?  Weird…Oh well, at least he got a band name out of it…years later…the forgotten prophecy started to become true…
